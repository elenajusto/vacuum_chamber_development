# Vacuum Chamber Development
This is a desktop prototype for a vacuum chamber being developed for the UTS Rocketry Team. 

The aim for this desktop prototype is to develop and test a closed loop controller that is 
able to produce the pressure curve generated by Open Rocket simulations.

This is to test avionics sensors and hardware that used on high powered rockets.

## Prototype 2.1 - Arduino
Prototype 2.1 is running on the Arduino platform. It has currently demonstrated very basic
altitude holding, being able to maintain a simulated altitude of ~200 meters inside the 
desktop chamber.

<b>Libraries:</b>
- Wire.h
- LiquidCrystal_I2C
- AdafruitBMP280
